        <p>Negligence has been blamed for the death of a 12-year-old student at Ecole des Sciences de Musanze over the weekend
        after it was alleged that school authorities denied her permission to go home, keeping her at school, despite her
        deteriorating condition.
        
        Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) on Monday confirmed that it arrested the school nurse, identified as Jean
        Nyiramugisha, who is accused of holding 12-year-old Ange Cécile Umuhire in the school dispensary for nearly a week until
        she passed on May 13 in the Northern Province-based school.
        
        Nyiramugisha, who was also in charge of discipline and ethics, was arrested the same day and is being held at Muhoza RIB
        Station, her file pending transfer to Prosecution.
        
        The passing of Umuhire, who was in S1, caused anger, with social media users and commentators accusing Church-owned
        schools for being ruthlessly hard on children, especially when it comes to seeking permission to go home due to a health
        condition.
        
        According to the RIB Spokesperson, Dr. Thierry B. Murangira, Nyiramugisha, investigations into the incident are ongoing
        to uncover more on the incident which has been blamed on negligence. RIB warned caregivers against neglecting duty,
        which is in contravention of the law.
        
        “Negligence of responsibility or failure to help a person in danger when you have the duty is punishable under Article
        244 of Law No. 68/2018 of 30/08/2018 that provides for crimes and penalties in general,” Dr. Murangira said, adding that
        those charged with neglecting the deceased child at a time of need will be held accountable.
        
        If found guilty, the person can be condemned to imprisonment of not less than 1 year but not more than 3 years and a
        fine not less than 300,000 FRW but not more than 500,000 FRW.</p>
