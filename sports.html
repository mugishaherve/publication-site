                <p>The tie was delicately balanced following the 1-1 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu eight days earlier and Pep Guardiola
                selected the same starting line-up for the second leg.
                
                While there were plenty of nerves amongst fans before kick-off, the atmosphere was raucous as the players emerged onto
                the Etihad pitch to an incredible noise.</p>
                
               <p> And the players maintained their composure as they dominated the opening moments high up the pitch and forced the
                reigning champions back into their own half.
                
                After early opportunities for Haaland and Rodrigo that failed to test Thibaut Courtois, the Madrid keeper was called
                into action in the 12th minute to make a brilliant save to keep out Haaland’s close-range header before David Alaba
                scrambled the loose ball off the line.</p>
                
                <p>And the Belgium keeper made an even better save from Haaland in the 21st minute when he somehow tipped his goalbound
                header around the post.
                
                But Courtois was finally beaten just over 60 seconds later when City’s incisive passing cut through Madrid’s defence
                again.</p>
                
                <p>De Bruyne’s pass found Bernardo with space in the box and the winger sent Courtois the wrong way, beating him at his
                nearpost.
                
                The visitors tried to catch City on the break but Kyle Walker was quick out of the blocks to stop the dangerous Vinicius
                Junior and Ederson was alert to cut out a throughball to Karim Benzema.</p>
                
                <p>Madrid’s first effort came 10 minutes before the break with a thunderous 25-yard strike from Toni Kroos struck the
                crossbar after a slight touch from Ederson.
                
                And City made them pay seconds later, when Jack Grealish linked up with Ilkay Gundogan in the Madrid box and when the
                German’s effort was deflected, Bernardo delicately looped a header over Alaba who had retreated to his goal-line.</p>

            <p>Madrid tried to establish a foothold in the game at the start of the second half with Carlo Ancelotti pushing his
            full-backs further up the pitch.
            
            And Ederson was at his best to tip over a swerving, dipping free-kick from Alaba five minutes after the restart.</p>

        <p>City continued to push for a third with Grealish a constant menace and forcing Madrid into a handful of fouls whenever
        he threatened.
        
        Haaland was to be denied once again by Courtois when he raced onto Gundogan’s backheel but his shot flicked off the
        keeper’s boot and onto the crossbar.</p>
        
        <p>But a third came in the 77th minute when De Bruyne’s dangerous free-kick was turned in by Akanji after initially being
        awarded to Madrid defender Eder Militao.
        
        The Spanish side continued to push and Ederson made a double save to keep them out but it was City that added the icing
        on the cake.</p>
        
        <p>Alvarez sprinted onto Phil Foden’s pass and the striker calmly slotted the ball past Courtois with the minimum of fuss.
        
        The full-time whistle was not too far away and there were joyous celebrations on the pitch and in the stands as we
        sealed a place in the Champions League final for a second time.</p>
